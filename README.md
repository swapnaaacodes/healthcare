# 🧠 Health Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is **High Risk** or **Low Risk** based on their vital health parameters using Machine Learning.

✔ Implements a complete ML pipeline  
✔ Uses advanced feature engineering  
✔ Fine-tunes SVC model for better performance  
✔ Handles imbalanced dataset  
✔ Saves trained model using joblib  
✔ Supports multiple patient prediction  
✔ Generates evaluation graphs  
✔ Includes interactive Streamlit web app

## 🚑 Problem Statement

Early detection of health risk is important to prevent serious medical conditions.  
Given only basic vital signs, we predict the **health risk category**:

- **High Risk**
- **Low Risk**

This helps in **quick medical triage** where full diagnostic tests are not available.

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains records of **7000 patients** with the following features:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Heart Rate | Beats per minute |
| Respiratory Rate | Breaths per minute |
| Body Temperature | Celsius |
| Oxygen Saturation | Percentage % |
| Age | Years |
| Gender | Male / Female |
| Risk Category | Target (“High Risk” / “Low Risk”) |

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

We created additional features to improve model performance:

- Oxygen_Deficit = 100 - Oxygen Saturation  
- HR_per_Age = Heart Rate / Age  
- Stress_Index = Heart Rate × Respiratory Rate  
- Temp_Risk = Temperature × Respiratory Rate  
- Severe_Condition (low oxygen + high HR)  
- Fever_Flag (temperature > 38°C)  

These features help the model capture **hidden health patterns**.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model Used

We used:

✔ **Support Vector Classifier (SVC - RBF Kernel)**

- Handles non-linear relationships  
- Uses `class_weight='balanced'` for imbalanced data  
- Probability enabled for confidence output  

---

## 🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning

We used:

- RandomizedSearchCV  
- Cross-validation (cv=2)  
- Metric: **F1 Score (weighted)**  

Tuned parameters:
- C  
- gamma  

✔ Best model is saved as:  
`models/best_model.joblib`

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

Since the dataset is imbalanced, we used:

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- **F1-Score (Primary Metric)**  

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation Outputs

The model generates:

✔ Confusion Matrix → shows prediction errors  
✔ Prediction Distribution → shows class imbalance  
✔ Feature Importance → using permutation importance
